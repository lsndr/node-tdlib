# node-tdlib

## Install

### Use prebuilt binaries

```
npm i wfjsw/node-tdlib --save
```

NPM will automatically download the appropriate `tdlib.node` binary.

Will compile automatically (using a lot of time) if there doesn't exist a suitable binary. If you do not need it, pass `--ignore-scripts` to `npm`.

List of prebuilt binary is available [here](https://github.com/wfjsw/node-tdlib/releases).

### Compile on your own

```
git clone https://github.com/wfjsw/node-tdlib.git --recurse-submodules
cd node-tdlib
npm i
npm run compile
npm ln
```

When you need to use it, run

```
npm ln tdlib
```

Dependencies: cmake, gperf, zlib, node >= 10.0.0, same OpenSSL(libssl-dev) version with Node.js

You may check your Node.js Dependency by using `node -p process.versions`

Be careful when use `gcc` and `g++` as they will use up to 8GB memory. `clang` compiler is preferred but not required. Using `clang` will result in less memory requirement on compilation.

Optional Dependencies: ccache (will speed up subsequent compilation.)
